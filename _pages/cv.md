In the project, I was responsible for back-end development and cloud development configuration, which was my first exposure to cloud development technology. Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of the concepts, principles, and use of cloud development. I learned how to create a mini program project on the WeChat developer tool platform, how to configure the cloud development environment, and build database tables and collections. I am familiar with the writing and use of SCF, and can handle the front-end requests and data storage, and interact and dock with the front-end data.
