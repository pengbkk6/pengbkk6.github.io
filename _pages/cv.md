Project Experience
======
* As a course design, a WeChat mini program for garbage sorting was developed through team collaboration:
In the project, I was responsible for back-end development and cloud development configuration, which was my first exposure to cloud development technology. Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of the concepts, principles, and use of cloud development. I learned how to create a mini program project on the WeChat developer tool platform, how to configure the cloud development environment, and build database tables and collections. I am familiar with the writing and use of SCF, and can handle the front-end requests and data storage, and interact and dock with the front-end data.
In addition, I learned to use cloud storage to manage and store pictures and other multimedia files in the garbage sorting applet. Through this project, I have also become more familiar with the front-end and back-end collaboration processes and development methods.
Through regular meetings and communication, our team has clarified the needs and goals of the project, and formulated a detailed plan and division of labor. I am familiar with the whole process of Scrum methodology in agile processes.
